# Maze UI

This module contains the Swing-UI for the [maze client](../mazegame-client-ktor).
This is the least documented module, and I am not sorry for it.
Swing never stopped being a mess.
Maybe there will be an improved ui in the future, but for now this should suffice.

I am a backend developer and this UI is almost the limit of what I can possibly achieve, when it comes to UIs :-)
